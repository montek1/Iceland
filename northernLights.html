      <h2 id="nlText">One of Iceland's most famous attractions is its Northern Lights. This breathtaking phenomenon,
          also known as aurora borealis, are a result of solar particles interacting with the magnetic field
          of the Earth. There can be a numerous amount of colors of these lights, such as blue, green, red, purple, and orange.
          In Iceland, there are multiple avenues through which an individual can witness these events, such as northern
          light tours. In Iceland, the months in which the Northern Lights are most likely to be seen can be seen in
