        <h2 id="BSBText">While Iceland is abundant with beautiful, jaw dropping natural attractions, this website will
        highlight three. The first is the blue lagoon. This is a geothermal spa using seawater that many tourists really
        enjoy. It located in a volcano field, and is one of Iceland's most visited attractions. Second, we have
            Skógafoss, a waterfall located in the south of Iceland. This is one if Iceland's biggest and widest waterfalls
        , and is known for frequently displaying a rainbow. The third and final attraction is Askja Caldera. This is at the
            site of an active volcano, and is 50 KM in size. The water is 30 degrees celcius, making it a great place to take
        a dip.</h2>
